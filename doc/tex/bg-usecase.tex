\subsection{Potential use-cases}

a remote acquisition process is required, or at least preferred


a) bespoke or niche equipment is used, which then cannot be scaled to

   or
b) scientific tenets such as open access and reproducibility demand
   the same equipment be used

\subsubsection{}
cryptographic design or standardisation process requires a forms of build-it, break-it, fix-it approach
