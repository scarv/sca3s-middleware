Among documents associated with the so-called Snowden revelations, the NSA 
exploit catalogue is arguably the most concrete and illuminating.  Analysis
of the content has led many commentators to remark on a lack of traditional
cryptanalytic breakthroughs.  Put simply, and although interpreting various
aspects at face value, the implication is that modern cryptography indeed
offers the security margins expected.  The state of end-point security is, 
however, {\em significantly} less positive in that similar security margins
are either degraded or rendered moot by deficiencies in the implementation 
of hardware, software, or a combination of both.  The increased emphasis on
end-to-end security, while sane, makes this particularly problematic: the
end-points, where security-critical storage and computation are paramount,
also seem demonstrably {\em in}secure.

A recurring exemplar is the potential for implementation attacks against a
given target; the mechanism used to mount such an attack will intrinsically
depend on the concrete implementation, and hence behaviour of said target,
vs. an abstract design for example.
The importance of implementation attacks can be motivated by observing that
an given attacker might not behave as they {\em should} (i.e., as expected)
but however they {\em can}.  To render ineffective the security afforded by
some encryption scheme, for example, they might target
a) the concrete, in practice implementation
   {\em or}
b) the abstract, on paper    design
of said scheme.  Typically, they will select the option for which they can
succeed most easily (colloquially, the weakest link).  If security of the
scheme is (provably) related to some hard Mathematical problem, traditional
cryptanalysis is unlikely to be easy at all.  Opting for an implementation
attack, however, offers the potential to bypass the associated difficulty:
the hard problem might be rendered moot if the attack instead focuses on a
feature (e.g., flaw) in the implementation of it.

In addition to the relative ineffectiveness of cryptanalysis against modern
cryptographic designs, a variety of trends illustrate why concrete attacks
based on this concept are such a threat; a non-exhaustive set of examples
follows.

\begin{enumerate}

\item There has been an obvious societal shift toward demand for, and even
      dependency on digital information systems; such systems often process
      security- and identity-related data, while also operating within an
      adversarial environment.

\item There is often significant potential for application at scale, which
      typically amplifies the potency of attacks.  Examples include where
      a) increased connectivity permits attacks to be mounted remotely via
         a network (e.g., targeting a web-server),
         or
      b) a large number of similarly viable targets exist (e.g., massive
         deployment of some embedded devices such as a smart-phone, or IoT
         device).

\item In   theory,
      increased complexity   of      such targets
      offers an intuitive deterrent against attack;
      contact-based side-channels related to power consumption {\em may} be
      rendered infeasible by electronic or architectural complexity.
      In practice,
      however, the ``attacks only get better'' principle is evident: use of
      contact-less side-channels, such as EM, have been harnessed against
      System-on-Chip (SoC) components, 
      smart-phones,
      and even
      full-scale personal computers
      operating at multi-gigahertz clock frequencies.

\end{enumerate}

Within an attack landscape of increasing breadth and complexity, it has been
suggested that treating security as a first-class goal is
a) {\em necessary},
   and thus
b) the {\em duty} of hardware security Engineers.
Along such lines, robust mitigation of side-channel attacks is, on one hand,
supported by a rich, mature corpus of literature; mitigation techniques (or
countermeasures) are increasingly well understood.  On the other hand, the
concrete vs. abstract nature of side-channel attacks fundamentally dictates
challenges wrt. selecting, instrumenting, and assessing the efficacy of such
mitigations.

Viewed at a high level, a given side-channel attack involves (at least) two 
processes:
a) an acquisition    process, 
   where interaction with the target device yields an associated data set,
   then
b) a (crypt)analysis process,
   where data set is used satisfy a goal such as 
    (generic) leakage assessment
   or 
   (specific) key recovery.
